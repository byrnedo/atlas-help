# Finding and Using Boxes

A primary use case of Atlas by HashiCorp is to be able to easily find
boxes you can use with Vagrant that contain the technologies you need
for a Vagrant environment. We've made it extremely easy to do that:

1. Go to the [Discover page](/discover)

2. Search for any box you want, or use the navigation on the left
   to see [featured](/discover/featured) boxes.

3. Once you find a box, click its name to learn more about it.

4. When you're ready to use it, copy the name, such as "hashicorp/precise64"
   and initialize your Vagrant project with `vagrant init hashicorp/precise64`.
   Or, if you already have a Vagrant project created, modify the Vagrantfile
   to use the box: `config.vm.box = "hashicorp/precise64"`
