# What are Boxes?

Boxes are the package format for Vagrant environments. A box can be
used by anyone on any platform that Vagrant supports to bring up an
identical working environment.

The easiest way to use a box is to add a box from the [box search](/boxes/search),
a public catalog of Vagrant boxes.

You can also add and share your own customized boxes in this same public or
private catalog by [creating one](/help/guides/vagrant-box-create-and-distribute).

Boxes also support versioning so that members of your team using Vagrant
can update the underlying box easily, and the people who create boxes can
push fixes and communicate these fixes efficiently.

Learn more about the [box release lifecycle](/help/vagrant/boxes/lifecycle).
