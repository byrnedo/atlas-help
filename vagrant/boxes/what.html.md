## What are Boxes?

Boxes are the package format for Vagrant environments. [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com)
is built by HashiCorp and is a tool to create and manage portable development
environments. A box can be used on any Vagrant-supported platform
to bring up an identical working environment across a development team.

The easiest way to use a box is to download one from the
[public catalog of Vagrant boxes](/boxes/search).

You can add and share your own customized boxes in this same public or
private catalog by [creating one](/help/guides/vagrant-box-create-and-distribute).

Boxes support versioning to allow for easy updates, transparent fixes, and clear
communication. Learn more about the
[box release lifecycle here](/help/vagrant/boxes/lifecycle).
