## Automating Packer Builds

Atlas can run Packer for you in our infrastructure. This enables
faster and more reliable build times, consistent build environments,
shared history, web UI workflows and notifications.

In this way, Atlas functions as a CI for image creation. When combined
with other Atlas features, these images can be deployed or turned into
[Vagrant Boxes](/help/vagrant/boxes).
