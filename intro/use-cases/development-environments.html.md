## Managing Development Environments

Using Atlas with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) enables teams to update and version
development environments via [Boxes](/help/vagrant/boxes). Boxes can be
hosted and versioned in Atlas.

Developers can update to the latest version of the development
environment with the `vagrant box update` command.

Additionally, Developers can [share](/help/vagrant/shares) access to their running environment
with anyone in the world.

Learn more about [Vagrant in Atlas](/help/vagrant/features).
