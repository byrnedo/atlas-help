## Infrastructure Monitoring

Leveraging [Consul health checks](), Atlas can monitor at the node or
service level across datacenters. Alerts of failed health checks
can be automatically sent to Email, Slack or Pagerduty and are
recorded in a web UI for auditing and management.

Connecting Consul to Atlas only requires one command to instantly
enable monitoring across your entire infrastructure.
