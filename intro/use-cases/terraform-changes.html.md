## Collaborating on Terraform Changes

Using Terraform in Atlas you can make changes to infrastructure
across large teams with total transparency of changes made. Changes are
seen and confirmed by any number of the team members and kept for all
time.

Atlas runs Terraform for you. Changes and logs are shown in the Atlas UI.
Plain text Terraform configuration is either pushed with the
Terraform command line client or linked to a GitHub repository.
