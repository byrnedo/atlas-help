## Atlas vs. Custom Solutions

Most organizations start by manually managing infrastructure and deploying
applications through simple scripts or web-based interfaces. As the organization
and infrastructure grows, manual management becomes error prone and
slow. Often, organizations create tooling around these processes
to help automate.

These tools require time and resources to build and maintain. As tools
of necessity, they represent the minimum viable features needed by an
organization, being built to handle only the immediate needs. As a result,
they are often hard to extend and difficult to maintain. Because the
tooling must be updated in lockstep with any new features,
it becomes the limiting factor for how quickly the organization can evolve.

Atlas builds on a suite of open source tooling that is well documented,
has a strong community force and is deployed in massive infrastructures.
Additionally, the Atlas workflow and approach is designed for changing
requirements as an organization evolves, removing the burden of
tool development to allow focus on other important business problems.
