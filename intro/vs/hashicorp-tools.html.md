## Atlas vs. HashiCorp Tools

HashiCorp tools are used by Atlas to perform core operations against
infrastructure, development processes, image building and more. Because
of this, it's possible to replicate Atlas functionality by just
using these tools.

However, Atlas provides a set of important features to increase
usability, between the various open source components that
form Atlas. Versioning, auditability, user interface, identity
authorization, object storage, integrated notifications, and alerts
are just some of the features Atlas adds to the open source
HashiCorp toolset.
