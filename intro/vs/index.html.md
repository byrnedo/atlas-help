# Atlas vs. Other Software

When evaluating software services it's important to compare alternative
solutions. This section seeks to make fact-based comparisons to other
similar software, be it commercial or open source.

Due to the bias of the comparisons being on the Atlas website,
we attempt to use only fact in the arguments. If you find something that is invalid
or out of date, please [send a pull request](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas-help/tree/master/intro/vs)
and we'll address your concerns.

Use the navigation on the left to read comparisons of Atlas versus
other systems.
