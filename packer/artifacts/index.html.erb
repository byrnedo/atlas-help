# About Packer and Artifacts

Packer creates and uploads artifacts to Atlas. This is done
with the [Atlas post-processor]().

Artifacts can then be used in Atlas to deploy services or access
via Vagrant. Artifacts are generic, but can be of varying types
like `amazon.ami` or `vagrant.box`. These types define different
behavior within Atlas.

Packer can create artifacts both while running in Atlas and out of Atlas'
network. This is possible due to the post-processors use of the public
artifact API to store the artifacts.

You can read more about artifacts and their use in the [Terraform section]()
of the documentation.
