# Contacting Support

All users of Atlas are urged to email feedback, questions or requests
to the HashiCorp team.

### [support@hashicorp.com](mailto:support@hashicorp.com)

We do not currently publish support SLAs for free accounts, but endeavour
to respond as quickly as possible. We respond to most requests
within less than 24 hours.

## HashiCorp Tools and Atlas Support

It's often the case that Atlas questions or feedback relates to the
HashiCorp tooling. We encourage all Atlas users to search for related
issues and problems in the open source repositories and mailing lists
prior to contacting us to help make our support more efficient and
to help resolve problems faster.

Visit the [updating tools](/help/intro/updating-tools) section
for a list of our tools and their project websites.

## Documentation Feedback

Due to the dynamic nature of Atlas and the broad set of features
it provides, there may be information lacking in the documentation.

In this case, we appreciate any feedback to be emailed to us so
we can make improvements. This documentation is also [available
on GitHub](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas-help) and can be
improved via pull requests.
