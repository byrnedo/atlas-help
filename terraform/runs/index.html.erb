# About Runs

A run in Atlas represents a two step Terraform plan and a subsequent apply.

As part of Terraform's standard execution pattern, Atlas presents
a plan that requires operator confirmation prior to being
applied. Upon confirmation, the apply runs.

Read more about [plans and applies](/help/terraform/runs/plans-and-applies).

Runs can be started via [GitHub or `terraform push`](/help/terraform/runs/starting).
